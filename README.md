## Milestone 2

### Image Scapping using Google Custom Search API
#### Steps used: mentioned in data-acquisition.md as well

- Create a Custom Search Engine ID and API key from Google Custom Search API console, https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/

- Created scrape.py that uses the image_scrapper functions to get the image urls using the Google Custom Search API resource object and saving it into a list, "urls".

- Saved the urls into a new file called "urls.txt" and downloaded the images from those urls

Below is a screenshot showing the scraped images for a blender, as an example of the outputs that can be found in Home-Depot-Semantic-Segmentation\data\data-raw
